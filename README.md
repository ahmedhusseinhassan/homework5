# Module 5 Homework: Data Platforms with Bruin
This repository contains the solutions to the Module 5 Homework for the Data Engineering Zoomcamp, focusing on Data Platforms with Bruin.
Questions and Answers
Question 1. Bruin Pipeline Structure
In a Bruin project, what are the required files/directories?
bruin.yml and assets/
.bruin.yml and pipeline.yml (assets can be anywhere)
.bruin.yml and pipeline/ with pipeline.yml and assets/
pipeline.yml and assets/ only
Answer: .bruin.yml and pipeline/ with pipeline.yml and assets/ 1
Question 2. Materialization Strategies
You're building a pipeline that processes NYC taxi data organized by month based on pickup_datetime. Which incremental strategy is best for processing a specific interval period by deleting and inserting data for that time period?
append - always add new rows
replace - truncate and rebuild entirely
time_interval - incremental based on a time column
view - create a virtual table only
Answer: time_interval - incremental based on a time column 2
Question 3. Pipeline Variables
You have the following variable defined in pipeline.yml:
YAML
variables:
  taxi_types:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
    default: ["yellow", "green"]
How do you override this when running the pipeline to only process yellow taxis?
bruin run --taxi-types yellow
bruin run --var taxi_types=yellow
bruin run --var 'taxi_types=["yellow"]'
bruin run --set taxi_types=["yellow"]
Answer: bruin run --var 'taxi_types=["yellow"]' 3
Question 4. Running with Dependencies
You've modified the ingestion/trips.py asset and want to run it plus all downstream assets. Which command should you use?
bruin run ingestion.trips --all
bruin run ingestion/trips.py --downstream
bruin run pipeline/trips.py --recursive
bruin run --select ingestion.trips+
Answer: bruin run --select ingestion.trips+ 4
Question 5. Quality Checks
You want to ensure the pickup_datetime column in your trips table never has NULL values. Which quality check should you add to your asset definition?
name: unique
name: not_null
name: positive
name: accepted_values, value: [not_null]
Answer: name: not_null 5
Question 6. Lineage and Dependencies
After building your pipeline, you want to visualize the dependency graph between assets. Which Bruin command should you use?
bruin graph
bruin dependencies
bruin lineage
bruin show
Answer: bruin lineage 6
Question 7. First-Time Run
You're running a Bruin pipeline for the first time on a new DuckDB database. What flag should you use to ensure tables are created from scratch?
--create
--init
--full-refresh
--truncate
Answer: --full-refresh 7
